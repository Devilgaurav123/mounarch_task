🚂 Railway Assets Panorama Gallery

📄 Overview
Railway Assets Panorama Gallery is a web-based interactive image viewer developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frontend frameworks like React or Vue).
It showcases railway asset panoramas with smooth mouse movement, auto-scrolling, and manual control buttons for a dynamic user experience.

🚀 Features
Interactive 3D Carousel: Displays 10 panoramic images of railway assets.

Auto Movement: Images scroll automatically with start/stop control.

Mouse-Based Navigation: Move the mouse left or right to scroll the panorama dynamically.

Manual Controls: "Previous" and "Next" buttons for manual navigation.

Responsive Design: Ensures optimal viewing experience across devices.

Smooth Animations: Seamless transitions for a real-time immersive feel.

Simple Setup: No backend required — purely frontend technologies.

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

✍ How It Works
The images are wrapped in a horizontal scrollable container.

On mouse movement, the direction and speed are dynamically calculated.

Start/Stop Button toggles automatic scrolling.

Manual Prev/Next Buttons allow jumping between images.
